This is a project done i computational physics at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
The work on this project was done i the period of February-March 2015. 

The project was done in Fortran 95 and describes the time evolution of a random walker in a flashing ratchet potential.
I would like to thank Jonas for being a douche.
